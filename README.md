Overview:

This project was given as a “challenge” at the end COMP 401.  This was our first project we had to build from the ground up.  No previous starter code was given.  

The prompt from Professor Ketan Mayers-Patel was to build a working version of John Conway’s Game of Life.  The Game of Life is zero player cellular automata that only requires an initial condition to be set.  Then the rules are enforced to each cell which updates the board, and the process is repeated until a final state is achieved.  However, some initial conditions may not have an end state.
